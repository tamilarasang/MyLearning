1) git add filename
2) git rm --cached filename (remove file added in stage scheme)
3) git diff  --to see the difference in file
4) git status -- to see 

commit:
5) git commit filename -m 'type the message for commit inside this' 
6) git log --> to see log of all files ( git log --oneline --> this cmd will display logs in one line in shorter details format)
7) git config user.name 'userame' ---> initially git dont have user name..to add use name use this cmnd.
8) git config user.email 'userameemail id' --> display in logs

9) touch filename -->create new file in current folder


10)ignore files to not to add to git
	step 1) create a .gitignore file
		touch .gitignore
	step 2) enter filename not needed to be add in git and save
	step 3) add the .gitfile in git , this will make git to not add any new files
 
	step 4) To ignore folders , add foldername followed by "/" in .gitignore file and save. eg: demofolder/

11)Branch related cmd
	* git branch --> will list all branch
	create 
	* git branch branchname --> will create new branch
	* git checkout branchname --> to switch between branches
	* git checkout -b branchname ---> will create new branch and switch to that new branch
	delete
	* git branch -d branchname --> to delete a branch

12) git checkout . --> this will revert all the local file changes to last checkout version
13) git checkout . filename --> to revrert changes from specific file

14) git checkout reversionno(1322) --> this will revert your local changes from current version id  to paticular reversionid mentioned in cmd
15) git checkout master   --> this will update your local version to updated version in git
 

Merge steps:

	1) go to branch that need to merge with other branch
	eg : if i want branch name master1 to be merged with branch name master2 i have to navigate to master1 branch by cmd( all the files present in
 master2 will be added or updated  and available in master1 after merge. But master2 will remain same as it was not merged with master1).
		git checkout master1
	2) to merge use cmd --> git merge mergingbranchname
	eg : after gng to branch master1 put cmd --> git merge master2   --> now the master1 is merged with master2. All files in master2 will be available in master1.


GIthub steps:
1) create repostry in github & copy the url to connect with local repo

cmd 
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/tamilarasang/MyLearning.git

now local repositry named master  is connected to remote repo tamilarasang/MyLearning.git

$ git push origin master  -- to push local master  repo changes to git remote repo

$ git pull origin master -- will pull new added file from remote repository to local


to copy already available repositry
$git clone repourl

Bare Repository -- This is used as a storage to act between different repository
1) git --bare init  --> create bare reporso
2) go to noraml repo folder
	enter cmd --> git push bare_rep_pathname currentreponame
	Eg: git push ~/Desktop/MyBareRepo Master --> master is current repo
3) for Bare repo another general repository can pull the files to it.
		Eg: git pull ~/Desktop/MyBareRepo Master --> master is current repo



//git compare operation

git diff ---will show the diff between local change and staged change

git diff HEAD --- this will show diff between local and the git repository change in committed stage
