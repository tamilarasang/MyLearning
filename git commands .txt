	* git checkout -b branchname ---> will create new branch and switch to that new branch
	delete
	* git branch -d branchname --> to delete a branch

12) git checkout . --> this will revert all the local file changes to last checkout version
13) git checkout . filename --> to revrert changes from specific file

Merge steps:

	1) go to branch that need to merge with other branch
	eg : if i want branch name master1 to be merged with branch name master2 i have to navigate to master1 branch by cmd( all the files present in
 master2 will be added or updated  and available in master1 after merge. But master2 will remain same as it was not merged with master1).
		git checkout master1
	2) to merge use cmd --> git merge mergingbranchname
	eg : after gng to branch master1 put cmd --> git merge master2   --> now the master1 is merged with master2. All files in master2 will be available in master1.
